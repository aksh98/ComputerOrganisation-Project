## A Safety Device for Women
This project aims to implement a personal protection device which can be used particularly by women or children to enforce safety in case of emergency situations. The device prototype could be extended to a miniature safety gizmo which could be clipped to jeans, belts, handbags or shoes when it is difficult or dangerous to access the phone.

_Intruder/Danger Sensed → Tap the device_ (or carry out a pre-defined custom gesture) → _Message sent to 5 emergency contacts or 5 nearest police stations_ (can be hard-coded in the device).
