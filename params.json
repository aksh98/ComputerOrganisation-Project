And when you are in panic dealing with getting out of the situation , you don't have the time to take out your phone or when you are in front of the person putting you in danger, you cannot access your phone at that instant.\r\n Security Devices like this are more than just a panic button, your alert can be sent discreetly just by the push of a button. \r\n\r\n### Components Used\r\nThe components used are:\r\n- 8051 Microcontroller\r\n- MAX-232\r\n- GPS Module\r\n- GSM Module\r\n- Push Button\r\n- Power Supply \r\n\r\nThe project uses an **8051 microcontroller** as the main hardware component. \r\nWithin it, the various architectural components are:\r\n\r\n  - Interrupts\r\n  - TX/RX pins\r\n  - Data Bus\r\n  - Address Bus\r\n  - Timer Delay\r\n  - Crystal Oscillator\r\n  - CPU\r\n\r\n## Design\r\nThe project aims to implement a personal protection device which can be used particularly by women or children to enforce safety in case of emergency situations. The device prototype could be extended to a miniature safety gizmo which could be clipped to jeans, belts, handbags or shoes when it is difficult or dangerous to access the phone.\r\n\r\nIntruder/Danger Sensed → Tap the device (or carry out a pre-defined custom gesture) → Message sent to 5 emergency contacts or 5 nearest police stations (can be hard-coded in the device).\r\n\r\n![Block Diagram]\r\n(https://github.com/aksh98/SafeFirst/blob/master/diag2.jpg?raw=true)\r\n\r\n### Interfacing Diagram\r\n\r\n![]\r\n(https://github.com/aksh98/SafeFirst/blob/master/diag.jpg?raw=true)\r\n\r\n### Milestones\r\n\r\nMilestones of our project:\r\n\r\n1. Firstly, figuring out how should we go about the project, all the steps and components which would be needed to make it upto our expectations.\r\n2. Making the GSM module work.\r\n3. Debugging our code.\r\n4. Setting up Baud-rate for GPS receiver. \r\n\r\n### Source Code\r\nOur source code can be found [here](https://github.com/aksh98/SafeFirst/blob/master/ourcode.c)\r\n\r\n### Concepts Used\r\n- Hardware Interrupts\r\n- Polling\r\n- Flags\r\n- Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)\r\n- Timers\r\n- Reset(Non maskable interrupt)\r\n- Delay subroutines\r\n- Direct Addressing\r\n- Serial Communication\r\n- Setting Baud Rate for different modules used(GPS,GSM)\r\n- 8051 microcontroller \r\n\r\n### Results\r\nOur code has been tested __successfully__. We were able make a prototype of the device which sends messages to the listed contacts just on the push of a button.\r\nIt was really fun working on the project. We got to learn about many things, GSM, GPS, interrupts and of course our 8051 microcontroller.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n- Akarsha Sehwag (@aksh98)\r\n- Aakash Deep Chhonkar\r\n- YS Ramya\r\n- Anannya Uberoi\r\n- Sarthak Jindal\r\n\r\n",
